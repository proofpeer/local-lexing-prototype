# Local Lexing Prototype Implementation

**Author:** Steven Obua (steven.obua@gmail.com)

This software accompanies the paper [Local Lexing](http://www.proofpeer.net/papers/locallexing). It is a prototype for local lexing implemented in Scala/ScalaJS. 

To run the examples (most of which correspond to Section 3 in the paper), run the following command from the top directory:

   sbt llJVM/run
   
This will compile the software for the Java Virtual Machine and present to you a list of examples from which you can choose.
