This software accompanies the paper [Local Lexing](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.03277). It is a prototype for local lexing implemented in Scala/ScalaJS. 

To run the examples (most of which correspond to Section 3 in the paper), run `sbt llJVM/run` from the top directory. This will compile the software for the Java Virtual Machine and present to you a list of examples from which you can choose. 

This prototype goes beyond what is described in the paper and contains experimental code for parametrized local lexing. The examples do not make use of these experimental features.
